# catalog-manager
1. A Catalog consists of a number of categories.
2. Categories may contain subcategories OR Products OR both.
3. Each Product must have at-least one SKU.
4. SKU refers to "Stock Keeping Unit". You might go to a store and find a pair of Jeans of a particular brand and design. That is your "product". That product may have a number of sizes, each of which can be sold. That "sellable" item form actual stock is called a SKU.
5. A SKU may not be restricted to only size. A particular product may also be available in multiple colors. Therefore, in that case a color-size combination can be considered as a SKU.
Although, many brand consider a different color as a different product altogether. That depends on how you configure your SKU/Products as per your need.
